Whoever receives a majority of the delegates' votes is elected. If no one receives a majority in the first round, runoffs are held between the top two candidates until one receives a majority. The presidential term is five years. A President may be elected any number of times, but not more than twice in succession."b"The President's powers are almost entirely ceremonial. Unlike presidents in the presidential system or the semi-presidential system, the President of Nepal is not even the nominal chief executive. The President does not have broad executive powers as an executive president would, as the Constitution explicitly vests executive power in the Council of Ministers and to a head of government, the Prime Minister."
