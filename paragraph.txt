b'This is a list of Presidents of France. The first President of France is considered to be Louis-Napol\xc3\xa9on Bonaparte (later Napoleon III), who was elected in the 1848 election, under the French Second Republic. The current President is Francois Hollande, from 15 May 2012. He was elected in the 2012 election.'b''b''b'The National Convention (20 September 1792 \xe2\x80\x93 26 October 1795) was led by a President (see List of Presidents of the National Convention); the Presidency rotated fortnightly.'b'From 1793 the National Convention was dominated by its sub-committee the Committee of Public Safety, in which the leading figures were Georges Danton and then Maximilien Robespierre.'cted by an electoral college comprising the Parliament of Nepal and the members of the provincial legislatures. Whoever receives a majority of the delegates' votes is elected. If no one receives a majority in the first round, runoffs are held between the top two candidates until one receives a majority. The presidential term is five years. A President may be elected any number of times, but not more than twice in succession."b"The President's powers are almost entirely ceremonial. Unlike presidents in the presidential system or the semi-presidential system, the President of Nepal is not even the nominal chief executive. The President does not have broad executive powers as an executive president would, as the Constitution explicitly vests executive power in the Council of Ministers and to a head of government, the Prime Minister."
