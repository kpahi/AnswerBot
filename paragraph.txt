b'Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Nepali: \xe0\xa4\xaa\xe0\xa5\x81\xe0\xa4\xb7\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xaa\xe0\xa4\x95\xe0\xa4\xae\xe0\xa4\xb2 \xe0\xa4\xa6\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xb2; born 11 December 1954), also known as Prachanda, is a Nepalese politician and the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist-Centre). He has been Prime Minister of Nepal since 2016; previously he was Prime Minister from 2008 to 2009.'b'Dahal led the CPN (M) as it launched a communist insurgency on 13 February 1996. In the ensuing civil war, more than 17,000 Nepalese died. Ultimately elections were held in 2008 and the CPN (M) emerged as the strongest party. The Constituent Assembly of Nepal elected Dahal as Prime Minister in August 2008.[1] He resigned as Prime Minister on 4 May 2009 after his attempt to sack the army chief, General Rookmangud Katawal, was opposed by President Ram Baran Yadav.[2]'b'Dahal is also widely known by his nom de guerre "Prachanda", a name he went by during his guerrilla days. In Nepali and some other Indo-Aryan languages languages, the word Prachanda is an adjective that translates to "fierce".[3]'b''b''b"Prachanda was born in Dhikur Pokhari, a village in Kaski District,[4] some 243 kilometres (151\xc2\xa0mi) west of Nepal's capital Kathmandu.[5][6][7] Prachanda spent much of his childhood and youth in Chitwan District. He received a diploma of science in agriculture (ISc-Ag) from Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science (IAAS) in Rampur, Chitwan, and was once employed at a rural development project sponsored by USAID: the project site was Jajarkot.[8] Prachanda's brother, Dr. Ganga Ram Dahal, graduated from the University of Reading, UK and is currently a Research Scientist at 'Rights to Resources International' based in Bangkok."b"Witnessing severe poverty among Nepalis since his youth, Prachanda was drawn to leftist political parties. He joined the underground Communist Party of Nepal (Fourth Convention) in 1981.[9] He became general secretary (party leader) of the Communist Party of Nepal (Mashal) in 1989. After several iterations, this party became the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). Prachanda lived in secret, even after the restoration of democracy in 1990. A little-known figure until then, he controlled the clandestine wing of the party, while Baburam Bhattarai represented the United People's Front in parliament. A biography written by Anirban Roy, the ex-Nepal correspondent of the Hindustan Times, covers Prachanda's 25 years living underground[10] and has been translated into Nepali as Prachanda: Ek Agyat Bidhrohi. Anirban Roy's book is also getting translated into Hindi and Assamese. Since 1996 Prachanda has been internationally known as the leader of the CPN (M), presiding over its military and political wings."b'On 4 February 1996, Bhattarai gave the government, led by Nepali Congress Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, a list of 40 demands, threatening civil war if they were not met. The demands related to "nationalism, democracy, and livelihood" and included such line items as the "domination of foreign capital in Nepali industries, business and finance should be stopped", and "discriminatory treaties, including the 1950 Nepal-India Treaty, should be abrogated" (referring here to the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship), and "land under the control of the feudal system should be confiscated and distributed to the landless and the homeless."[11] After that, and until 26 April 2006, Prachanda directed the military efforts of the CPN(M) towards establishing areas of control, particularly in the mountainous regions and in western Nepal.'b'The 40 demands were whittled down to 24 in subsequent political negotiations.[12]'b'In late 2004 or early 2005, relations between Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai soured.[13] This was reportedly due to disagreement on power sharing inside the party. Bhattarai was unhappy with the consolidation of power under Prachanda. At one point, Prachanda expelled Bhattarai from the party, though he was later reinstated.[14] They later reconciled at least some of their differences.[15][16]'
